We are [**Toon**](https://toonverbeek.com/) & [**Maurice**](https://www.mauricekleine.com/).

We love building software for the web — with over a decade of experience in building software, we have backgrounds in software engineering, product management and technical leadership. 

Individually, we’ve created or helped create dozens of software products from the ground up. Together, we’ve started **Subthread**: a product studio to help companies big and small go from idea → product.
